# Gecko Bounded Operation MVP Runbook

## Purpose

This runbook defines the temporary bounded Gecko operation entrypoint.

This is not always-on monitoring. It is not systemd, a scheduler, a queue
worker, or an unbounded watch. The operator runs one bounded command at a time,
then confirms the result with rawJson-free read-only CLIs.

The goal is not fastest possible sniping. The goal is a safe low-MC candidate
investigation OS: detect one pump.fun candidate, enrich it, append bounded
Metric observations, and verify the saved state without exposing rawJson or
secrets.

## Current Proven Scope

- `detect:geckoterminal:new-pools` pump-only watch write has passed three times with
  `/tmp` checkpoint, `--pumpOnly`, `--limit 1`, `--maxIterations 1`, and
  `--write`.
- `scripts/run-geckoterminal-detect-watch.sh` has passed one foreground
  bounded detect watch run with
  `LOWCAP_GECKOTERMINAL_DETECT_CHECKPOINT_FILE=/tmp/lowcap-gecko-detect-watch-pump-checkpoint.json`,
  `LOWCAP_GECKOTERMINAL_DETECT_INTERVAL_SECONDS=60`, `--pumpOnly`,
  `--limit 1`, and `--maxIterations 2`. It naturally exited after two cycles,
  created mint-only Tokens
  `5vLb2TaW3sx7bc8pPjmiZX3sYwBxb2kg9mW67ggspump` and
  `6MD8LtMX1Jf7W9hDs8rnthkeFS2sonzSaYiQHkZgpump`, reported
  `selectedCount=2`, `importedCount=2`, and `failedCount=0`, and advanced only
  the `/tmp` checkpoint to `2026-04-29T17:55:30.000Z |
  BWruAw7CYweENaRJ7WFrqSX6VEWd6qwteL3faiB5UgRi`.
- The first foreground-created mint,
  `5vLb2TaW3sx7bc8pPjmiZX3sYwBxb2kg9mW67ggspump`, has reached first Metric
  append plus rawJson-free report confirmation: enrich/rescore moved it from
  `mint_only` to `partial` as
  `Something Dumb` / `DUMB` with score `C` / `0`, `hardRejected=false`, and
  reviewFlags present; then single-mint Metric snapshot write appended Metric
  `id=1128` at `observedAt=2026-04-30T13:50:42.230Z`, moving
  `metricsCount` from 0 to 1. Token fields were preserved by the Metric write,
  Telegram was not sent, and `metrics:report`, `token:compare`, and
  `tokens:compare-report` now show Metric `id=1128` / `metricsCount=1` /
  latestMetric observedAt plus rawJson-free market-data presence columns. It
  has now also appended Metric `id=1129` at
  `observedAt=2026-04-30T14:23:38.900Z`, moving `metricsCount` from 1 to 2;
  previousMetric remains `id=1128` at
  `observedAt=2026-04-30T13:50:42.230Z`, so time-series append is confirmed.
  Token fields and Telegram state were unchanged by the second append, and
  two-Metric rawJson-free report confirmation has now passed: `metrics:report -- --mint ... --limit 2`
  shows Metric ids `1129 -> 1128`, both `observedAt` values, `volume24h=0` on
  both rows, and all four market-data presence columns true on both rows;
  `token:compare -- --mint ...` shows latestMetric `id=1129` and
  `recentMetrics` containing `1129` plus `1128`, each with true `safeSummary`
  booleans; `tokens:compare-report -- --source geckoterminal.new_pools
  --metadataStatus partial --hasMetrics true --minMetricsCount 2
  --latestMetricSource geckoterminal.token_snapshot --limit 10` includes the
  mint with `metricsCount=2`, latestMetric observedAt, and latestMetric safe
  summary columns. The report / compare output did not expose Metric rawJson and
  did not write to DB. The second
  foreground-created mint,
  `6MD8LtMX1Jf7W9hDs8rnthkeFS2sonzSaYiQHkZgpump`, has now reached first Metric
  append: enrich/rescore moved it from `mint_only` to `partial` as
  `Ghostpool` / `GHOST` with score `C` / `0`, `hardRejected=false`, and
  reviewFlags present; then single-mint Metric snapshot write appended Metric
  `id=1130` at `observedAt=2026-04-30T16:51:54.070Z`, moving `metricsCount`
  from 0 to 1. Token fields were preserved by the Metric write, Telegram was
  not sent, `volume24h=null`, and price / fdv / reserve / topPool presence were
  true. RawJson-free report confirmation has now passed through
  `metrics:report`, `token:compare`, and `tokens:compare-report`: Metric
  `id=1130`, `observedAt=2026-04-30T16:51:54.070Z`, `metricsCount=1`,
  `volume24h=null`, and latestMetric safe summary columns are visible without
  Metric rawJson. A second single-mint Metric snapshot write then appended
  Metric `id=1131` at `observedAt=2026-04-30T23:55:54.844Z`, moved
  `metricsCount` from 1 to 2, and left previousMetric as `id=1130` at
  `observedAt=2026-04-30T16:51:54.070Z`, confirming distinct time-series
  observations. Token fields were preserved, Telegram was not sent,
  `volume24h=null`, and price / fdv / reserve / topPool presence were true.
  Two-Metric rawJson-free report confirmation has now passed:
  `metrics:report` showed Metric ids `1131 -> 1130`, both `observedAt` values,
  `volume24h=null`, and all four market-data presence columns true;
  `token:compare` showed latestMetric `id=1131` and `recentMetrics` containing
  `1131` plus `1130`; and `tokens:compare-report` included the mint with
  `metricsCount=2` and latestMetric safe summary columns. Metric rawJson was
  not exposed by the report / compare output.
- All three watch-detected mints completed:
  detect -> enrich/rescore -> Metric 1 -> Metric 2 -> rawJson-free report
  confirmation.
- The third bounded watch-detected mint,
  `CQgM65qrpe3whqU2SJhcU7MfVhodL92zRADqanbvpump`, has now reached
  enrich/rescore plus first Metric append. It moved from `mint_only` to
  `partial` as `The People's House` / `PH`, then appended Metric `id=1126` at
  `observedAt=2026-04-29T16:27:01.275Z`. The same mint has also passed
  rawJson-free initial Metric report confirmation through `metrics:report`,
  `token:compare`, and `tokens:compare-report`. It has now also appended a
  second Metric, moving `metricsCount` from 1 to 2 and setting latestMetric to
  `id=1127` at `observedAt=2026-04-29T16:42:56.330Z`, while previousMetric
  remains `id=1126` at `observedAt=2026-04-29T16:27:01.275Z`. RawJson-free
  two-Metric report confirmation has also passed through `metrics:report`,
  `token:compare`, and `tokens:compare-report`.
- `metric:snapshot:geckoterminal` has passed bounded single-mint, batch,
  foreground, tmux append, and tmux no-candidate natural-exit gates.
- `metrics:report`, `token:compare`, and `tokens:compare-report` can confirm
  saved Metric state without showing Metric rawJson.
- User systemd is blocked in this environment, the default GeckoTerminal detect
  checkpoint is still unused, and always-on / scheduler / queue worker /
  unbounded watch operation is not implemented.

## Interim Adoption

Treat this bounded operation MVP as the current interim operating entrypoint.
It is suitable for deliberate, human-approved candidate accumulation, not for
always-on monitoring.

Adopted scope:

- detect uses the isolated `/tmp` checkpoint with `--pumpOnly`, `--limit 1`,
  an explicit `--maxIterations`, and `--write` only after explicit Red
  approval.
- enrich/rescore uses one `token:enrich-rescore:geckoterminal --write` for one
  mint.
- Metric capture uses one `metric:snapshot:geckoterminal --write` for one mint.
- reporting uses `metrics:report`, `token:compare`, and
  `tokens:compare-report` without Metric rawJson.
- the default GeckoTerminal detect checkpoint remains unused.
- every Red command remains exact, one-at-a-time, and explicitly approved.

Next-phase recommendation:

1. Keep this bounded MVP fixed as the daily operator workflow.
2. Run a separate read-only preflight before any detect tmux bounded watch
   attempt.
3. Separately decide whether metric snapshot tmux bounded operation should be
   the formal interim operating entrypoint.
4. Keep systemd deferred until user systemd is available.
5. Keep `token_completed` and `loop_complete` production live sends deferred
   until eligible candidates naturally exist.

Do not move to default checkpoint, long-running watch, unbounded watch,
scheduler / queue worker, restart-oriented operation, or systemd without a new
preflight and explicit Red approval.

## Daily Operator Order

Use this order when continuing bounded Gecko candidate accumulation.

1. Confirm repo state:

```bash
pwd
git status --short --branch
git log --oneline -8
```

2. Run a read-only preflight for the specific Red step being considered.

3. With explicit Red approval only, run one bounded detect watch write using
   the isolated `/tmp` checkpoint, `--pumpOnly`, `--limit 1`, and an explicit
   `--maxIterations`.

4. Confirm the created mint with `token:show` or a narrow read-only query.

5. Run `token:enrich-rescore:geckoterminal` dry-run for that mint.

6. With explicit Red approval only, run one
   `token:enrich-rescore:geckoterminal --write` for that mint.

7. Run `metric:snapshot:geckoterminal` dry-run for that mint.

8. With explicit Red approval only, run one
   `metric:snapshot:geckoterminal --write` for that mint.

9. Confirm with rawJson-free read-only reports:
   `metrics:report`, `token:compare`, and `tokens:compare-report`.

10. If time-series confirmation is needed, do a second Metric append preflight
    before any second `metric:snapshot:geckoterminal --write`.

## Red / Green Boundary

Green tasks:

- docs updates.
- read-only CLI commands.
- `metrics:report`.
- `token:compare`.
- `tokens:compare-report`.
- dry-run commands without `--write` or `--watch`.
- `pnpm exec tsc --noEmit` and targeted tests when requested.

Red tasks:

- `detect:geckoterminal:new-pools --write`.
- `detect:geckoterminal:new-pools --watch --write`.
- `token:enrich-rescore:geckoterminal --write`.
- `metric:snapshot:geckoterminal --write`.
- tmux session start.
- any systemd operation.
- Telegram live send.

Red commands must be exact, one-at-a-time, and explicitly approved before
execution.

## Proven Command Examples

These are examples of proven command shapes. They are not standing permission
to execute them.

Bounded detect watch write:

```bash
pnpm -s detect:geckoterminal:new-pools -- --watch --write --pumpOnly --limit 1 --maxIterations 1 --checkpointFile /tmp/lowcap-gecko-detect-watch-pump-checkpoint.json
```

Single-mint enrich/rescore write:

```bash
pnpm -s token:enrich-rescore:geckoterminal -- --mint <MINT> --write
```

Single-mint Metric snapshot write:

```bash
pnpm -s metric:snapshot:geckoterminal -- --mint <MINT> --write
```

RawJson-free report checks:

```bash
pnpm -s metrics:report -- --mint <MINT> --limit 2
pnpm -s token:compare -- --mint <MINT>
pnpm -s tokens:compare-report -- --source geckoterminal.new_pools --metadataStatus partial --hasMetrics true --minMetricsCount 1 --latestMetricSource geckoterminal.token_snapshot --limit 10
```

## Stop Conditions

Stop before continuing if any of these happen:

- `selectedCount > 1`.
- `importedCount > 1`.
- `failedCount > 0`.
- rate limit, timeout, or network instability.
- the command may touch the default checkpoint.
- rawJson, `.env`, token, chat id, or other secret display risk appears.
- the next step would require removing `--maxIterations`.
- the task expands into systemd or tmux outside the explicitly approved step.
- Telegram sending becomes part of the path.
- the exact command differs from the approved command.

## Reporting Rules

Reports should summarize counts, Metric ids, `observedAt`, sources, and
safe-summary booleans. Do not paste raw payloads, Metric rawJson, huge stdout /
stderr, environment variables, or secret values.

For Metric confirmation, prefer:

- `metrics:report` for Metric row history.
- `token:compare` for single-token latestMetric and `recentMetrics`.
- `tokens:compare-report` for cohort-level latestMetric and `metricsCount`.

## Out Of Scope / Still Unconfirmed

- detect foreground / tmux operation.
- detect long-running watch.
- default checkpoint operation.
- systemd start / enable.
- scheduler / queue worker.
- unbounded watch.
- restart-oriented operation.
- `token_completed` production live send.
- `loop_complete` production live send.

## Next Phase Decision

The current bounded operation MVP is useful as a semi-automated investigation
workflow and should be treated as the interim MVP until a new preflight proves a
wider operating mode. The next practical step is either a detect foreground /
tmux watch preflight or a decision to formalize metric snapshot tmux bounded
operation as the interim operating mode. Service-style operation waits for a
user-systemd-capable environment.
